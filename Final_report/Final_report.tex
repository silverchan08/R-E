\section{Introduction}
Knot theory is a field of mathematics that studies simple closed curves embedded in three-dimensional space. Study of theta-curves and handcuff graphs is included in knot theory. In this research, we tried to get the minimal grid diagrams of those graphs, which are up to 7 crossings.\\ \\
We first decided to use the Python code to examine the minimal grid diagrams of theta-curves and handcuff graphs. For this, we found the method to classify theta-curve and handcuff graphs by their Cromwell matrices, which are called THC matrices. Finding all possible matrices for those graphs and finding out the Yamada polynomial of each graphs could give the minimal grid diagram of the graph. \\ \\
Also, we used some mathematical methods to found out the minimal grid diagrams by using the bounds of the arc index, and used the Python code to examine if we found the right grid diagrams. Then we tried to decrease the gap of upper and lower bounds, and found out arc indices of some graphs.

\section{Theoretical Background}

\begin{defn}
    \textit{$\theta$-curve} is a graph embedded in $S^3$, which consists of two vertices $v_1$, $v_2$ and three edges $e_1$, $e_2$, $e_3$, such that each edge joins the vertices.
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}
    \textit{Handcuff graph} is a graph embedded in $S^3$ consisting of two vertices ($v_1$, $v_2$) and three edges ($e_1$, $e_2$, $e_3$), where $e_3$ has distinct endpoints $v_1$ and $v_2$, and $e_1$ and $e_2$ are loops based at $v_1$ and $v_2$.
\end{defn}

\begin{figure*}[h!]
    \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{figure/theta and handcuff graph.png}}
    \caption{Examples of theta-curves and handcuff graphs.}
    \label{figure_1} 
\end{figure*}

In the projection of the handcuff graph and theta-curve, the section where they meet themselves is named \textit{crossing}. 
For each handcuff graphs and theta-curves, the minimal number of crossings are called the \textit{crossing number}.
If the one graph and other graph's continuous transform of the graph is same, these graphs are \textit{equivalent}. 
The \textit{Generalized Reidemeister Moves} are used to transfrom a projection of handcuff graphs and theta-curves.\\

\begin{figure*}[h!]
    \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figure/reidemeister.png}}
    \caption{Generalized Reidemeister moves.}
    \label{figure_1} 
\end{figure*}

A theta-curve is said to be trivial if it can be embedded in a $2$-sphere in $S^3$.
In the similiar way, a handcuff graph is said to be trivial if it can be embedded in a $2$-sphere in $S^3$.

\end{figure*}

\begin{defn}
    \textit{Arc presentation} is an open-book decomposition of $\mathbb{R}^3$ which has open half-planes as pages and the standard z-axis as the binding axis.
\end{defn}

Every spatial graph $G$ can be embedded in an open-book decomposition with finitely many pages so that it meets each page in exactly one simple arc with two different end-points on the binding axis.
In knot theory, \textit{arc index}, is the minimal number of pages among all possible arc presentations of graph. This arc presentation with the minimal number of pages is \textit{minimal arc presentation.} \textit{Prime knots} are knots that is not constructed by combining simpler knots. We are finding the arc index for the prime theta-curve and handcuff graph up to seven crossings.

\end{figure*}


\begin{defn}
    The \textit{grid diagram} is a handcuff graph or theta‐curve diagram of vertical strands and one less number of horizontal strands with the properties that at every crossing the vertical strand crosses over the horizontal strand and no two horizontal segments are co‐linear and no two vertical segments are co‐linear.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
   The \textit{Cromwell matrix} is an $n \times n$ binary matrix each of whose rows and columns has exactly two 1s. 
   For theta‐curve and handcuff graph, its Cromwell matrix is called the 
   the \textit{THC-Cromwell matrix} is the matrix that satisfies the following conditions.
\end{defn}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item It is a binary $n\times(n+1)$ matrix.
    \item It has exactly two 1s in every column.
    \item There are only three 1s in two distinct rows (which are called the \textit{Three-row}) and every other rows has exactly two 1s.
\end{enumerate}

If the 1s of the Cromwell matrix are connected by horizontal and vertical lines with vertical lines are always on the horizontal lines, it leads to the grid diagram. The arc presentation can be expressed by grid diagram and vice versa. They are in one-to-one correspondence. Also, if the number of half planes in arc presentation is $\alpha$, then the size of corresponding grid diagram is $(\alpha - 1) \times \alpha$.\\

    \caption{An arc presentation and a grid diagram of the knot}
    \label{figure_2}
\end{figure*}

\begin{theorem}
    Every $\theta$-curve and handcuff graph admit an arc presentation.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    For any theta-curve and handcuff graph, we can put it on a grid by using some suitable planar isotropy.
    Then for every crossing it has, there are only two following cases. \\
    \begin{figure*}[h!]
        \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{figure/crossings.png}}
        \caption{Cases for crossings}
        \label{figure_2}
    \end{figure*}
    \\ For each crossings, if it is a first case, then it is over.
    However, if it is a second case, then we can make that crossing to first case using some suitable movement. \\
    \begin{figure*}[h!]
        \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.25\linewidth]{figure/move crossing.png}}
        \caption{Suitable movement for case 2}
        \label{figure_2}
    \end{figure*}
    \\ Therefore, it becomes the grid diagram and since the grid diagrams and arc presentations are in one-to-one correspondence, there always exists arc presentations for every theta-curve and handcuff graph.
\end{proof}

\begin{defn}
    The \textit{link with $n$-components} is an embedding of the disjoint union of $n$ circles $S^1 \cup \cdots \cup S^1$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$. $1$-component link is called a \textit{knot}.
\end{defn}

The polynomial of the knot is invariant. \textit{Yamada polynomial} is invariant when it is mulitplied $(-x)^n$ for some integer n. The \textit{spread} of a knot, is substraction of maximal degree of minimal degree of the polynomial. It is a invariant since Yamada polynomial is invariant when mulitplied by $(-x)^n$.\\

Let 3 edges of theta-curve is $e_1, e_2, e_3$, then $e_1 \cup e_2$, $e_2 \cup e_3$, $e_3 \cup e_1$ becomes a knot on 3-sphere. This knots are \textit{consituent knot} of the theta-curve.

\begin{defn}
    \textit{Stacked tangle} of an theta-curve and handcuff graph is stacked disks each with the frame as boundary with following properties:
\end{defn}
\begin{itemize}
\item Only two disk called \textit{non-simple disks} contain one vertex and three line
segments which joins the vertex and boundary point.
\item One of the non-simple disks is at the top.
\item Other disks called \textit{simple disks} contain simple arc which joins two
points on the boundary.
\item When view from above
\begin{itemize}
    \item two arcs in different simple disks intersect at most one point (by RII)
    \item arc in simple disk and tree in non-simple disk intersect at most one
point (by RV)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

    \caption{Stacked tangle representations.}
\end{figure*}

\textit{Simple closure} of stacked tangle is a stacked tangle with \textit{caps} satisfying following properties:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A \textit{cap} is a simple arc in outside of stacked tangle joining end points of arcs or line segments
    \item When view from above any tow caps have no intersection.
\end{itemize}
Then a simple closure of a stacked tangle without any nested caps is
corresponding to an arc presentation.\\

A \textit{reduced simple closure of a stacked tangle} is
\begin{itemize}
    \item a simple closure of a stacked tangle without any nested caps
    \item any two arcs(including line segment) joining by caps have no intersection when view from above
\end{itemize}

%\begin{proof}
%$$\alpha(\theta) \leq c(\theta) + e + b$$ when e is number of edges, b is number of bouquet cut-components. We have 3 edges, 0 bouquet cut-componentes for theta-curves. Therefore, $$\alpha(\theta) \leq c(\theta) + 3.$$
%\end{proof}

\section{Research Methods and Procedure}
First, we made a Python Code to find the arc index and the cromwell matrix of the knots. Then we used the upper and lower bounds, and also found the smaller upper bounds and larger lower bounds. Finally we used the direct method to find the arc index by drawing the binding circle.

\subsection{The Python Code}
The Python code generates the possible Cromwell matrices of theta-curves and handcuff graphs, and compares with the existing ones in the table which is less or equal to 7 crossings.
It eventually returns the Cromwell matrix of the compared theta-curve and handcuff graph.
To distinguish the Cromwell matrices from theta-curves and handcuff graphs, which is generated and removed by the rules from the above section, we should use the determinant of the Cromwell matrices.\\
%\begin{defn}
%The \textit{grid diagram} of a knot is a projection that consists only of horizontal and vertical lines, and the vertical line always passes above the horizontal line. (However, in this case, there must be exactly two points (excluding the vertices) that are vertically bent for each horizontal line (row) and vertical line (column), and the two vertices must be on the horizontal line.)
%\end{defn}

%\begin{theorem}
%Every theta-curve and handcuff graph has its corresponding THC-Cromwell matrix.
%\end{theorem}
\begin{defn}
    Let any THC-cromwell matrix G. Consider any Three-row $i$(called \textit{deleted-row}) and its three 1s, $a_{ij}, a_{ik}, a_{il}$, which means that $a_{ij} = a_{ik} = a_{il} = 1$ and $j < k < l$. The \textit{H-deletion Matrix} of the THC-cromwell matrix is $(n-1)\times(n-1)$ matrix which deleted row $i$ and column $j$, $l$ (which are called the \textit{edge-columns}) from the matrix G.
    The 1s contained in both ith row and jth, lth columns are called the \textit{edge-one}, and the 1 contained in both ith row and kth column is called the \textit{middle-one}.\\
\end{defn}

    \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figure/Hdeletion.png}}
    \caption{H deletion of THC-matrix of theta-curve $3_1$.}
    \label{figure_1} 
\end{figure*}

\subsubsection{Main Theorem}
\begin{theorem} In case the given THC-cromwell matrix is $\theta$-curve or handcuff graph, then the given THC-Cromwell matrix is theta-curve if and only if determinant of the H-deletion matrix is $\pm 1$. Also, the given THC-Cromwell matrix is handcuff graph if and only if determinant of the H-deletion matrix is $0$ or $\pm 2$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Determinant of the cromwell matrices of Knot}\\
    The cromwell matrix of a knot is a $n\times n$ binary matrix which has exactly two 1s for each rows and columns
    We are interested of the determinant of the cromwell matrix of knots, so we are going to use the row and column operations to get simpler matrix.
    In this way, determinant of the Cromwell matrix would change only by multiplying $\pm 1$.\\
    Now we follow these \textit{H to D} steps : \\
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Since there are always exactly two 1s in every row, there exists two columns that containing the 1s of the top row. Using column operations, interchange those two columns with the left most and secondary left most columns of the matrix.
        \item Choose secondary column from the left. It should contain another 1 below the 1 which is from the top row, so interchange a row containing that below 1 with secondary top row by using row operations.
        \item Cover the left most column and top row and repeat (a), (b) (What you need to careful is that when you interchange the row, you should also change the covered elements together.) until we get the following matrix.
    \end{enumerate}
    
    $$\begin{pmatrix} 
    1 & 1 & 0 & \cdots & 0\\
    0 & 1 & 1 &  &  \\
    0 & 0 & 1 & & \vdots\\ 
    \vdots & & & \ddots & \\
    1 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & 1
    \end{pmatrix}$$
Next, we apply the row operation. We add each row above the bottom row to the bottom row.
    $$\begin{pmatrix} 
    1 & 1 & 0 & \cdots & 0\\
    0 & 1 & 1 &  &  \\
    0 & 0 & 1 & & \vdots\\ 
    \vdots & & & \ddots & \\
    2 & 2 & \cdots & 2 & 2
    \end{pmatrix}$$
If n is even, by subtracting bottom row with $2R_1, 2R_3, ... , 2R_{n-1}$ We can get a matrix like
    $$\begin{pmatrix} 
    1 & 1 & 0 & \cdots & 0\\
    0 & 1 & 1 &  &  \\
    0 & 0 & 1 & & \vdots\\ 
    \vdots & & & \ddots & \\
    0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & 0
    \end{pmatrix}$$
Since the last row is zero row, the determinant is 0. \\
If n is odd, by subtracting bottom row with $2R_1, 2R_3, ... 2R_{n-2}$, we can get a following matrix. 
    $$\begin{pmatrix} 
    1 & 1 & 0 & \cdots & 0\\
    0 & 1 & 1 &  &  \\
    0 & 0 & 1 & & \vdots\\ 
    \vdots & & & \ddots & \\
    0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & 2
    \end{pmatrix}$$
Since it is upper triangular matrix, we can obtain determinant by trace. Hence the other entry is all 1, the determinant is $\pm 2$.\\

\item \textbf{Proof in the case of theta-curve}\\
Since the THC-cromwell matrix is not a $n\times n$ matrix, we consider H-deletion matrix of THC-cromwell matrix to get its determinant.
Actually, in the THC-cromwell matrix, the 1s in same column represents the vertical line of the grid diagram, and the 1s in same row represents the horizontal line of the grid diagram.
Therefore, we can think H-delation matrix represents a grid diagram (here, we consider the more general version of grid diagram. It is a diagram consisted of vertical strands and horizontal strands with the properties that at every crossing, the vertical strand crosses over the horizontal strand, and no two horizontal segments and vertical segments are co-linear) without three horizontal lines and three vertical lines. 
Now, we are going to count n, which is the number of $1$s in the middle column and edge-columns(deleted horizontal lines) of Three-row i, which is also included in another Three-row j.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{When $n = 0$}\\
    As we consider the non-deleted row's middle-one, the horizontal line and vertical lines that contain it is not deleted since $n=0$. Therefore, the grid diagram represents a graph consisted a vertex (which is corressponding to middle-one) and three edges that connect this vertex with another three vertices.
    We'll call it as the \textit{T-shape}.

        \caption{Examples of T-shape (Red line is a deleted line and blue line is a T-shape)}
        \label{figure_1} 
    \end{figure*}
    \item \textbf{When $n = 1$ (middle-one)}\\
    As we consider the non-deleted row's middle-one, a horixontal line that contains it is deleted since $n=1$ at the middle-one. Therefore, the grid diagram represents a graph consisted a vertex (which is corressponding to middle-one) and two edges that connect this vertex with another two vertices.
    Since there are only two lines connected to middle-one, we can say that this grid diagram represents a graph consisted of two vertices and an edge connecting them. 
    We'll call it as the \textit{Line-shape}.

        \label{figure_1} 
    \end{figure*}
    \item \textbf{When $n = 1$ (edge-one)}\\
    As we consider the non-deleted row's middle-one, a vertical line that consisted of the middle-one and deleted edge-one is deleted. Therefore, the grid diagram represents a graph consisted a vertex (which is corressponding to middle-one) and two edges that connect this vertex with another two vertices.
    Since there are only two lines connected to middle-one, the grid diagram represents a Line-shape.
    \item \textbf{When $n = 2$ (edge-ones)}\\
    As we consider the non-deleted row's middle-one, the horizontal line connected to it is not deleted, but other lines are all deleted. Therefore, the grid diagram represents a Line-shape.
    \item \textbf{When $n = 2$ (middle-one and edge-one)}\\
    As we consider the non-deleted row's middle-one, the horizontal line and the vertical line(consisted of middle-one and deleted edge-one) are deleted. Hence, there is only one vertical line is connected to middle one.
    Therefore, the grid diagram represents a Line-shape.
    \item \textbf{When $n = 3$ (middle-one and edge-ones)}\\
    Trivial $\theta$-curve is the only way satisfying this condition. Therefore, its H-deletion matrix is (1) hence the determinant of H-deletion matrix is 1.

    \end{pmatrix}$$
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}[label={(\roman*)}]
    \item \textbf{Line-shape}\\
    The Line-shape is consisted of two vertices and an edge connecting them, and the grid diagram of the Line-shape is consisted of horizontal and vertical segments. This means that the H-deletion matrix, which is a Line-shape, is a $n\times n$ matrix with following properties :
    \begin{itemize}
        \item It is a binary matrix.
        \item One and only one of the following is satisfied
        \begin{itemize}
            \item There exists only one row which contains exactly one 1, and another row which contains exactly three 1s. Every other row contains exactly two 1s. Also, there exists only one column which contains exactly one 1. Every other column contains exactly two 1s. (Type-(b))
            \item There exists only one row which contains exactly one 1. Every other row contains exactly two 1s. Also, there exists only one column which contains exactly one 1. Every other column contains exactly two 1s. (Type-(c),(d),(e))
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    In case the Line-shape is a type-(b), we use the \textit{H to D} steps, including following step instead of (a) step of first cycle:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Interchange a row and the column with exactly one 1 with the first row, and the last column. Interchange the rest row with exactly one 1 with the last row.
    \end{enumerate}
    Therefore, after applying \textit{H to D} steps, we can get a following matrix.
    $$\begin{pmatrix}
        1 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & 0\\
        1 & 1 & 0 & & & \vdots \\
        0 & 1 & 1 & & & 1\\
        \vdots & & & \ddots &1 & \vdots \\
        0 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 1 &0
    \end{pmatrix}$$
    Also, if we subtract each row with its upper row starting from the top, we can get a upper triangular matrix, which diagonal entries are $1$ or $-1$. Therefore, the determinant of the type-(b) H-deletion matrix is $\pm 1$.\\
    In case the Line-shape is a type-(c),(d),(e), we use the \textit{H to D} steps, including following step instead of (a) step of first cycle:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Interchange a row with exactly 1 one with the top row.
    \end{enumerate}
    Therefore, after applying \textit{H to D steps}, we can get a following matrix.
    $$\begin{pmatrix}
        1 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & 0\\
        1 & 1 & 0 & & &\\
        0 & 1 & 1 & & & \vdots\\
        \vdots & & & \ddots &1 \\
        0 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 1 &1
    \end{pmatrix}$$
    Then, if we subtract each row with its upper row starting from the top, we can get a diagonal matrix, which diagonal entries are all 1. Therefore, the determinant of the type-(c),(d),(e) H-deletion matrix is $\pm 1$. \\
    As a result, the determinant of Line-shape H-deletion matrix is $\pm 1$.
    
    \item \textbf{T-shape}\\
    The T-shape can be understood as the combination of two Line-shapes. To be specific, the H-deletion matrix of T-shape is $n\times n$ matrix with following properties :
    \begin{itemize}
        \item It is a bianry matrix.
        \item There exists only one row with exactly three 1s, and two rows which contains exactly one 1. Also, there exists only one column which contains exactly one 1, and other columns contain exactly two 1s.
    \end{itemize}
    Using row and column operations, we can make two regions in the matrix. One is the intersection of the first to $k$th row and first to ($k-1$)th column. Another is the intersection of $k$th to $n$th row and $k$th to $n$th column. Each region represents a Line-shape. \\
    \begin{figure*}[h!]
        \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth]{figure/region.png}}
        \caption{Dividing Regions.}
        \label{figure_1} 
    \end{figure*}
    \\
    The red square region is a $(n+1)\times n$ matrix such that :
    \begin{itemize}
        \item It is a binary matrix.
        \item There are only two rows contains exactly one 1, and every other rows and columns contain exactly two 1s.
    \end{itemize}
    The blue square region is a H-deletion matrix, which is a type-(c),(d),(e) Line-shape.
    Using \textit{H to D} steps in the red square including 'Interchange a row with exactly one 1 with the top row.' instead of step (a) at the first time, and
    using \textit{H to D} steps in the blue square including 'Interchange the columns with exactly one 1 with the fist column and last column.' instead of step (a) at the first time,
    we can get a following matrix.
    $$\begin{pmatrix}
        1 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & 0 & 0\\
        1 & 1 & 0 & & \vdots & 0 & 0\\
        0 & 1 & 1 & & 1 & \vdots & \vdots\\
        0 & 0 & 1 & \ddots & \vdots & 0 & 0 \\
        \vdots & & &  &  & \vdots & \vdots \\
        0 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 1 &1 & 0\\
        0 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 &1 & 1
    \end{pmatrix}$$
    For a red square, we subtract each row with its upper row starting from the top row. For a blue square, we subtract each column with its right column starting from the last column.
    As a result, we can get a upper triangular matrix, which diagnoal entries are all $1$. Hence the determinant of T-shape is also $\pm 1$.

    
\end{enumerate}
Therefore, $\pm 1$ will be the determinant of the theta-curve's H-deletion matrix.

\item \textbf{Proof in the case of handcuff graph}\\
    Similiar with $\theta$-curve, we are going to count n of the THC-cromwell matrix, which is the number of $1$s in the middle column and edge-columns of Three-row i, which is also included in another Three-row j.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{When $n = 0$}\\
        Considering non-deleted row's middle one, there exists three lines connected to it. We'll call it as the \textit{T-loop}. Therefore, the H-deletion matrix will be union of a T-loop and a Line-shape.
        \begin{figure*}[h!]
            \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth]{figure/T-loop.png}}
            \caption{Examples of union of T-loop and Line-shape.}
            \label{figure_1} 
        \end{figure*}
        \item \textbf{When $n = 1$ (middle-one)}\\
        Considering non-deleted row's middle one, the horizontal line connected to this middle-one is deleted. Therefore, the H-deletion matrix will be union of a knot and a Line-shape.
        \item \textbf{When $n = 1$ (edge-one)}\\
        Considering non-deleted row's middle one, a vertical line that consisted of the middle-one and deleted edge-one is deleted. Therefore, the H-deletion matrix will be union of a knot and a Line-shape.
        \item \textbf{When $n = 2$ (edge-ones)}\\
        This is not possible since if two different row's edge-ones are connected, then it becomes the $\theta$-curve.
        \item \textbf{When $n = 2$ (middle-one and edge-one)}\\
        Similiar with (d), This is not possible.
        \item \textbf{When $n = 3$}\\
        Similiar with (d), This is not possible.
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \begin{enumerate}[label={(\roman*)}]
        \item \textbf{T-loop}\\
        T-loop can be understood as the combination of a knot and a Line-shape. Therefore, the H-deletion matrix is $n\time (n+1)$ matrix. If we delete the last column(we will call this matrix as \textit{deleted-T-loop}), we can get a form of
        $\left(\begin{array}{c|c} Knot & *
        \\ \hline 0 & Line-shape
        \end{array}\right)$
        , where knot and Line-shape is a $n\times n$ and $k\times k$ matrices. Hence
        the determinant is det(knot)det(Line-shape) = $0$ or $\pm 2$.
        \item \textbf{Union of T-loop and Line-shape} \\
        We knot that T-loop and Line-shape is independent, which means that there are no 1s in same rows or columns. Therefore, the H-deletion matrix is a form of
        $\left(\begin{array}{c|c} deleted-T-loop & *
        \\ \hline 0 & Line-shape
        \end{array}\right)$ \\
        hence the determinant is det(deleted-T-loop)det(Line-shape) = $0$ or $\pm 2$.
        \item \textbf{Union of Knot and Line-shape} \\
        Knot and Line-shape is also independent. Therefore, the H-deletion matrix is a form of 
        $\left(\begin{array}{c|c} Knot & *
        \\ \hline 0 & Line-shape
        \end{array}\right)$
        hence the determinant is $0$ or $\pm2$    
    \end{enumerate}
Therefore, $0$ or $\pm 2$ will be the determinant of the handcuff graph's H-deletion matrix.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}

\subsection{Bounds of Arc Index}
We found the bounds of arc index by the theoretical background, or we found the new bounds inspired by the theoretical background.
For the $\theta$-curve, it is known that the following theorems hold.

\begin{theorem}[2]
Let T be any $\theta$-curve and $K_1$, $K_2$, $K_3$ be three constituent knots of T. Then $$\alpha(T) \geq \underset{i \in \{1,2,3\}}\max \alpha(K_i) + 1.$$
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[2]
Let T be any $\theta$-curve and $K_1$, $K_2$, $K_3$ be three constituent knots of T. Then $$\alpha(T) \geq \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^3\alpha(K_i).$$
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[2]
For any $\theta$-curve $\theta$, $$\alpha(\theta)\geq\frac{1+\sqrt{f(\alpha(\theta))+36c(\theta)}}{3} \left(f(x) = \begin{cases} 
		73 & x \equiv 0 \pmod 6\\ 
		4 & x \equiv 1 \pmod 6\\ 
		25 & x \equiv 2 \pmod 6\\ 
		-8 & x \equiv 3 \pmod 6\\ 
		49 & x \equiv 4 \pmod 6\\ 
		20 & x \equiv 5 \pmod 6\\ 
     \end{cases} \right).$$
\end{theorem}

\begin{prop}[2]
For $\theta$-curve $T$,
\[ \alpha(T) \leq c(T) + 3 \]
where $c(T)$ is the crossing number of $T$.
\end{prop}

Now, for the handcuff graph, the followings hold.

\begin{theorem}[5]
    If $L$ is an alternating and non-split link, then
    \[ \alpha(L) = c(L)+2. \]
    %crossing number 정의를 써야하나???
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[3]
    For any spatial graph $H$,
    \[ \alpha(H) \leq c(H)+e+b, \]
    where $e$ is the number of the edge and $b$ is the number of the bouquet.
\end{theorem}

\begin{corol}
    If $H$ is a handcuff curve,
    \[ \alpha(H) \leq c(H)+5. \]
    Especially, if the constituent link of $H$ is non-split,
    \[ \alpha(H) \leq c(H)+3. \]
\end{corol}

\begin{proof}
    If $H$ is a handcuff curve, the number of the edge is $3$, and the number of the bouquet is at most $2$. Thus the first inequality holds since $e=3, b \leq 2$. If there is a bouquet, one of the loops can be pulled out without affecting the rest. (See figure 13.) Then, if we remove the vertex edge of $H$, the remaining constituent link is a split link. Thus there are no bouquet if the constituent link of $H$ is non-split, and we have second inequality since $e=3, b=0$.
\end{proof}

\begin{figure*}[h!]
    \centerline{\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{image.png}}
    \caption{Pulling the bouquet}
    \label{figure_4} 
\end{figure*}

\begin{prop}
    For a handcuff curve $H$, let $L$ be the constituent link of $H$. Then,
    \[ \alpha(H) \geq \alpha(L)+1. \]
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
    In the arc presentation of $H$, let $v_1$, $v_2$ be the vertices of $H$. Then, there are half-planes that contain the vertex edge of $H$. If we remove them, the remainder is the arc presentation of $L$, the constituent link of $H$. Since the number of half-planes that contain the vertex edge is at least $1$, we obtain
    \[ \alpha(H) \geq \alpha(L) + (\text{the number of half plane that contain vertex edge}) \geq \alpha(L)+1. \]
\end{proof}

Using the Theorem 15, we obtain the following corollary.

\begin{corol}
    In the handcuff curve, if its constituent link $L$ is alternating and non-split, then
    \[ \alpha(H) \geq c(L)+3. \]
\end{corol}

\begin{proof}
    Since $L$ is alternating and non-split link, then $\alpha(L)=c(L)+2$ by Theorem 15. Thus, \[\alpha(H) \geq \alpha(L)+1 = \left( c(L)+2 \right)+1 = c(L)+3\] according to Proposition 18.
\end{proof}

We now consider the Yamada polynomial of the handcuff curve and investigate the relationship between the difference of its maximum and minimum degrees and the arc index.

\begin{defn}
    For a graph $G=(V, E)$, where $V$ is vertex set of $G$ and $E$ is edge set of $G$, let us define $2$-variable Laurent polynomial
    \[ h(G)(x, y) = \sum_{F \subset E} (-x)^{-|F|} x^{\mu(G-F)} y^{\beta(G-F)} \]
    where $\mu(G)$ and $\beta(G)$ is the number of connected components of $G$ and the first Betti number of $G$. \\
    Then, the Yamada polynomial of a graph $G$, $R(G)$ is defined by
    \[ R(G)(x) = h(G)(-1, -x-2-x^{-1}). \]
\end{defn}

It is known that, for some integer $n$, the product $(-x)^n R(G)$ (where $R(G)$ is the Yamada polynomial of the spatial graph $G$) is an ambient isotopy invariant. Moreover, the Yamada polynomial satisfies the following properties.

\begin{theorem}
    For the Yamada polynomial, the following properties hold.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $R( \cdot ) = -1$
        \item Let $e$ be a non-loop edge of a graph $G$. Then, $R(G) = R(G / e) + R(G - e)$, where $G/e$, $G-e$ denote the graphs obtained by contracting and deleting the edge $e$, respectively.
        \item Let $e$ be a loop edge of a graph $G$. Then, $R(G) = -(x+1+x^{-1}) R(G-e)$.
        \item Let $G_1 \cup G_2$ be a disjoint union of graphs $G_1$ and $G_2$. Then, $R(G_1 \cup G_2) = R(G_1)R(G_2)$.
        \item Let $G_1 \cdot G_2$ be a union of graphs $G_1$ and $G_2$ having one common point. Then, $R(G_1 \cdot G_2) = -R(G_1)R(G_2)$.
        \item If $G$ has an isthmus, then $R(G)=0$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
    For the Yamada polynomial, the following properties hold.
    \begin{figure*}[h]
        \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{yamada_property.png}}
        \caption{Properties of Yamada polynomial}
        \label{figure_3}
    \end{figure*}
\end{theorem}

Now, using the stacked tangle representation and the Yamada polynomial, we establish lower bounds for the arc index of $\theta$-curves and handcuff graphs.

\begin{prop}
Let $S_G$ be the simple closure of a stacked tangle of a $\theta$-curve or handcuff graph $G$. Then
\[
    \max\deg_x R(G) \leq c+n, \quad \min\deg_x R(G) \geq -(c+n),
\]
where $c$ and $n$ are the number of caps and crossings in $S_G$, respectively.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
Let a \emph{simple cap} be a cap connecting two simple disks, and a \emph{semi-simple cap} be a cap connecting a simple disk and a non-simple disk.
We use double induction on $(c_s + c_{ss}, n)$, where $c_s$ and $c_{ss}$ are the numbers of simple caps and semi-simple caps, respectively.

\subsubsection*{Basis Step}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item When $c_s + c_{ss} = 0$ \\
    Since $c_s = c_{ss} = 0$, $S_G$ has no simple disks. Applying the Yamada relation Y14, we obtain
    \[
        R(S_G) = -x^{\pm 3}(-x^2 - x - 2 - x^{-1} - x^{-2}),
    \]
    and it holds the inequalities $\max\deg_x R(S_G) \le c+n$ and $\min\deg_x R(S_G) \ge -(c+n)$.

    \item When $n=0$ \\
    There are no crossings, so $S_G$ consists of trivial handcuff graph and the disjoint disks. Then $R(S_G)=0$ and clearly $0 \le c+n$, so the inequalities hold.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Inductive Step}
Assume the theorem holds for all $(c_s' + c_{ss}', n') < (c_s + c_{ss}, n)$ with $c_s + c_{ss} > 0$. Consider $S_G$ with $c_s$ simple caps, $c_{ss}$ semi-simple caps, and $n$ crossings.

Let $D_s$ be the topmost simple disk connected to the top disk, and $D$ the disk directly above $D_s$. We distinguish two cases: \\

\textbf{Case 1.} No cap between $D_s$ and $D$
\begin{enumerate}
    \item If $D_s$ and $D$ do not intersect, swapping their positions does not change $S_G$.
    \item If $D_s$ and $D$ intersect, apply Yamada relation Y9:
    \[
        R(S_G) - R(S_G^-) = (x-x^{-1}) \big(R(S_G^0) - R(S_G^\infty)\big),
    \]
    where $S_G^-, S_G^0, S_G^\infty$ are obtained by replacing $\Xslashfront$ with $\Xslashback$, $\czero$, $\cinf$, respectively.
    $S_G^0$ and $S_G^\infty$ has fewer crossings than $S_G$, so the induction hypothesis ensures the following inequalities:
    \begin{align*}
        \max\deg_x R(S_G^0) \le c+n-1, \quad \min\deg_x R(S_G^0) \ge -(c+n-1) \\
        \max\deg_x R(S_G^\infty) \le c+n-1, \quad \min\deg_x R(S_G^\infty) \ge -(c+n-1)
    \end{align*}
    Therefore, if $S_G^-$ satisfies the inequality, then $S_G$ does also.
\end{enumerate}
From the two cases above, when there is no cap between $D_s$ and $D$, it suffices to consider the diagram obtained by swapping $D_s$ and $D$.
Repeating this process, we reduce to the case where a cap exists between $D_s$ and $D$. \\

\textbf{Case 2.} There is a cap between $D_s$ and $D$
\begin{enumerate}
    \item If $D$ is a simple disk \\
    When view from above, there are three cases:

    \begin{figure*}[h]
        \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{figure/three_cases.png}}
        \label{figure_3}
    \end{figure*}

    \\ When the first case, we can easily reduce the caps, and the inequality holds by inductive hypothesis. When the second and third cases,
    we can reduce the cap and crossing using Y10. Let $S_G'$ be a reduced diagram with $c-1$ caps, $c_s - 1$ simple caps, $c_{ss}$ semi-simple caps, and $n-1$ crossings.
    By inductive hypothesis,
    \[
        \max\deg_x R(S_G) = \max\deg_x R(S_G') \pm 2 \le c+n, \quad
        \min\deg_x R(S_G) = \min\deg_x R(S_G') \pm 2 \ge -(c+n).
    \]

    \item If $D$ is non-simple disk \\
    When there is no intersection between $D_s$ and $D$, we can easily reduce the caps, and the inequality holds by inductive hypothesis. Suppose there is an intersection. \\
    When viewed from above, all the cases can be reduced as follows:

    $$\begin{tabu}to .8\linewidth {X[7,c]X[c]X[2,c]X[c]X[7,c]X[c]X[2,c]}
		$\includegraphics[width=1.1cm]{figure/DDQ11.png}$ \raisebox{.4cm}{or} $\raisebox{-.2cm}{\includegraphics[width=1cm]{figure/DDQ12.png}}$ & \raisebox{.4cm}{$\longrightarrow$} & $\includegraphics[width=1cm]{figure/DDQ15.png}$ & & $\includegraphics[height=1cm]{figure/DDQ13.png}$ \raisebox{.4cm}{or} $\raisebox{-.2cm}{\includegraphics[width=1cm]{figure/DDQ14.png}}$ & \raisebox{.4cm}{$\longrightarrow$} & $\includegraphics[width=1cm]{figure/DDQ15.png}$\\
		$S_G$ &  & $S_G'$ &  & $S_G$ &  & $S_G''$
		\end{tabu}$$

    Applying Y10 and Y14, we can reduce diagrams $S_G'$ and $S_G''$ with $c-1$ caps, $c_s$ simple caps, $c_{ss}-1$ semi-simple caps, and $n-1$ crossings. Then by induction,
    \begin{align*}
        \max\deg_x R(S_G) = \max\deg_x R(S_G') \pm 1 \le c+n, \quad \min\deg_x R(S_G) = \min\deg_x R(S_G') \pm 1 \ge -(c+n) \\
        \max\deg_x R(S_G) = \max\deg_x R(S_G'') \pm 2 \le c+n, \quad \min\deg_x R(S_G) = \min\deg_x R(S_G'') \pm 1 \ge -(c+n)\\
    \end{align*}
    and the inequalities hold for $S_G$.
\end{enumerate}

Thus, by induction, the inequalities hold for all simple closures of stacked tangles of $\theta$-curves and handcuff graphs.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
Let $S_G$ be a reduced simple closure of a stacked tangle corresponding to a minimal arc presentation of $G$. Then
\[
    \max\deg_x R(S_G) - \min\deg_x R(S_G) - 2n \le \alpha(G),
\]
where $n$ is the number of crossings and $\alpha(G)$ is the arc index of $G$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
In a minimal arc presentation, the number of caps $c$ equals the arc index $\alpha(G)$. Since $S_G$ is reduced simple closure, we can insert curls at each caps.
Depending on the direction of the curl, we classify them into positive and negative curls, and let $p$ denote the number of maximum negative curls. \\
Let $S_G^{neg}$ and $S_G^{pos}$ denote the diagrams with negative and positive curls inserted, respectively. Then,
\[
    R(S_G^{neg}) = x^{-2p} R(S_G), \quad
    R(S_G^{pos}) = x^{2(c-p)} R(S_G).
\]
By analyzing the maximum and minimum degrees,
\begin{align*}
    \min\deg_xR(S_T) - 2p & = \min\deg_xR\left(S_T^{neg}\right)\\
    & \ge -c - (n+p)\\
    \max\deg_xR(S_T) + 2(c-p) & = \max\deg_xR\left(S_T^{pos}\right)\\
    & \le c + \left[n+(c-p)\right]\\
    \min\deg_xR(S_T) & \ge -c - n + p \\
    \max\deg_xR(S_T) & n + p \\
    \max\deg_xR(S_T) - \min\deg_xR(S_T) & \le c+2n 
\end{align*}
and we obtain
\[
    \max\deg_x R(S_G) - \min\deg_x R(S_G) \le c + 2n = \alpha(G) + 2n.
\]
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
Let $G$ be any $\theta$-curve or handcuff graph. Then
\[
    2 + \sqrt{\max\deg_x R(S_G) - \min\deg_x R(S_G) - 4} \le \alpha(G),
\]
where $R(G)$ is the Yamada polynomial of $G$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $S_G$ be a reduced simple closure of a stacked tangle corresponding to a minimal arc presentation of $G$.
Then, the number of caps is $\alpha(G)$, and $S_G$ has $2$ non-simple disks and $\alpha(G)-3$ simple disks.
The maximal number of crossings $n$ in $S_G$ can be estimated as follows. \\

\textbf{Case 1.} $\theta$-curve

\begin{enumerate}
        \item The number of crossings between simple disks is at most $\binom{\alpha(G)-3}{2}$.
        \item The number of crossings between simple and non-simple disks is at most $2 \cdot (\alpha(G)-3)$.
        \item The number of crossings between the two non-simple disks is at most $2$, except for the trivial theta curve.
\end{enumerate}

However, for each cap, the two arcs that it connects have no crossing since $RS_T$ has no nested caps.
Moreover, any pair of simple arcs is connected by at most one cap.
Note that between the two non-simple disks, there are at most two caps, except in the trivial theta curve case. \\
Therefore, we obtain the following upper bound on $n$ in terms of $\alpha(G)$:

\[
n \le \binom{\alpha(G)-3}{2} + 2(\alpha(G)-3) + 2 - (\alpha(G)-2) = \frac12 (\alpha(G)^2 - 5\alpha(G) + 8).
\]


\\ \textbf{Case 2.} Handcuff graph
\begin{enumerate}
        \item The number of crossings between simple disks is at most $\binom{\alpha(G)-3}{2}$.
        \item The number of crossings between simple and non-simple disks is at most $2 \cdot (\alpha(G)-3)$.
        \item The number of crossings between the two non-simple disks is at most $1$.
\end{enumerate}

In contrast to the $\theta$-curve, a simple arc in a handcuff graph can intersect a non-simple arc connected to two caps, due to the two loops.
Moreover, as there is at most one cap between the non-simple disks since there is only one edge between the two vertices. \\
Thus, the number of crossings satisfies the same upper bound:

\[
n \le \binom{\alpha(G)-3}{2} + 2(\alpha(G)-3) + 1 - (\alpha(G)-3) = \frac12 (\alpha(G)^2 - 5\alpha(G) + 8).
\]

\\ By Theorem 24,
\[ \max\deg_x R(S_G) - \min\deg_x R(S_G) \le 2n + \alpha(G) \le \alpha(G)^2 - 4\alpha(G) + 8. \]
Solving for $\alpha(G)$ yields
\[
2 + \sqrt{|\max\deg_x R(S_G) - \min\deg_x R(S_G) - 4|} \le \alpha(G),
\]
which completes the proof.
\end{proof}

\section{Further Researches}
    We want to fix every arc index of handcuff graph and theta-curve graph up to $7$ crossings.
    Also, we want to apply bounds of spatial graphs to knots.
    Since we found the minimal diagram of some theta-curves and handcuff graphs up to $7$ crossings, it can be used as reference for other researches.
    Moreover, since we could not use the Topoly package, we would like to use another tool for examining the arc indicies.
