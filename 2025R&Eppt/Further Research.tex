    \begin{itemize}
        \item We tried to use the Python for determining arc indices.
        For the Python program, we used the Topoly package, but the package had an error.
        We would like to use another tool to completely determine the arc indices of $\theta$-curves and handcuff-graphs, such as Yamada package.
        \item Applying the result of our research to $\theta$-curves or handcuff-graphs of higher crossings or to other spatial graphs can be researched further.
    \end{itemize}
