\section{Upper Bounds of Arc Index}

\begin{frame}{Upper Bounds of Arc Index}
	For a spatial graph $G$, $c(G)$ denotes the crossing number of $G$.
	\begin{thm}[Lee et al., 2018]
		Let $G$ be a spatial graph. Then,
        \[ \alpha(G) \le c(G) + e + b \]
		where $e$ and $b$ are the number of edges and bouquet cut points, respectively.
	\end{thm}

	\begin{corollary}
		Let $G$ be a non-trivial prime $\theta$-curve or handcuff graph. Then,
        \[ \alpha(G) \le c(G) + 3. \]
	\end{corollary}
